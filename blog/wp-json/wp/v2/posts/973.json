The exact cause of vertigo is often challenging to identify. Still, it is typically a result of a disruption in the body&#8217;s balance system, which is regulated by the inner ear, eyes and brain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of Vertigo<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of vertigo: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vestibular neuritis.

Homeopathic remedies are believed to work by stimulating the body&#8217;s healing response.<br>There is some evidence that homeopathy can be effective for treating vertigo.

It is important to note that mainstream medical professionals do not widely accept homeopathy as a cure for vertigo or any other condition.
