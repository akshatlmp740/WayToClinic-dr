Hormonal shifts lead to the growth of sex organs and can cause involuntary ejaculation during sleep. This often happens because of sexual dreams or the body&#8217;s natural response to hormonal changes. While Nightfall is common among young boys, men of any age can experience it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it&#8217;s a typical occurrence, many find it embarrassing to discuss it with family or friends. Modern distractions such as pornography and misconceptions about sex can worsen the issue. Adolescents and young men need to receive accurate information about their bodies and sexual health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Nightfall<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nightfall is a natural occurrence in men and should not be a cause for concern.

Although often associated with adolescent males, females can also orgasm in their sleep. During the REM stage of sleep, increased blood flow to the pelvic region leads to vaginal wetting and arousal.
