These remedies promote healing, soften stools, and prevent recurrence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Rectal Fissure?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Rectal Fissure is a break or minimal injury that occurs in the skin around the anus, which is the exit of faeces from the body. That often leads to pain, which may occur during or after the bowel movements and may also lead to bleeding. The pain can be stabbing and sores can burn, and minor bleeding can be bright red blood on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rectal Fissures are primarily precipitated by the passage of hard or large stool, chronic <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-constipation-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"constipation\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2573\">constipation<\/a>, or by repeated strain during defecation. It may also be caused by <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"diarrhea\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2574\">diarrhea<\/a>, child birth or inflammation of the surrounding tissues. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they may cause pain, many Rectal Fissures can be treated at home effectively without requiring surgery, wherein the patient has to soften their stool, drink plenty of water, and apply certain ointments. Fissures that are frequent or chronic may be treated by a doctor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Rectal Fissure <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms of an Rectal Fissure can vary in severity but commonly include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pain During Bowel Movements:<\/strong> In most cases, Rectal Fissure shows a number of signs, such as sharp pain experienced while defecating. This pain can be described as sharpness or a tearing or cutting sensation and can be sharp enough for some of the patients to avoid defecation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Post-Bowel Movement Pain:<\/strong> The pain these Rectal Fissures cause is not only during defecation, but this pain may persist for several hours after the bowel movement. Some people say that after an episode, they experience a burning pain that persists, and that makes them concerned about future bowel movements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Visible Tear or Crack:\u00a0<\/strong>There is usually a break in the skin around the anus in order to cause a visible injury in the form of a Rectal Fissure.<\/span> This tear is normally a small break or ulcer and is usually situated at the level of the posterior midline of the anal canal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bleeding: <\/strong>Another sign is bright red blood from the rectum on toilet paper after wiping, the surface of passed stools or even in the toilet. This bleeding is generally mild; however, it is concerning to the persons experiencing it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Itching or Irritation:<\/strong> Itching or redness may also occur around the content of the fissure since the area becomes inflamed and produces a form of discharge or moisture.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cramping Around the Anus:<\/strong> Some people around the world may feel contraction-like pains in the surrounding area or region of the anal region, along with the pain that is felt during a bowel movement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Skin Tags: <\/strong>In more serious and prolonged conditions, patients might develop minor skin protuberances adjacent to the crack due to the trauma and then healing processes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spasms of the Anal Sphincter:<\/strong> Most of the people with Rectal Fissures feel a contraction in the ring-shaped muscle of the anus, which makes pain worse and defecation even more challenging. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Rectal Fissure <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the primary causes of Rectal Fissures based on the gathered information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Constipation:<\/strong> Rectal Fissures are most commonly caused by constipation, especially when one has to strain or pass a bowl of large and hard stool. The pressure needed to pass out such stools can easily cause the realization to have Fissures because the inner lining of the anus is torn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diarrhea: <\/strong>Prolonged diarrhea is also known to cause Rectal Fissures. Loose motions can cause inflammation and pain in the rectal region in case bowel movements are too often and quick.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Childbirth: <\/strong>Rectal Fissures are likely to occur in women during or after childbirth since pressure is applied on the anal area. During the delivery, it is true that the stretching and all the trauma associated with that vulnerable area can irritate the tissues around the anus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): <\/strong>Several diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-colitis-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"colitis\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2571\">colitis<\/a> make inflammation in the G.I. tract, even in the anal area. This inflammation can make the tissue a little less stiff or stronger, but at the same time, it increases the likelihood of the tissue tearing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tight Anal Sphincter Muscles:<\/strong> Those with too tight muscles around the anal canal may experience much tension in the region, thereby making the anal canal especially vulnerable to rips during defecation. In this area, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-muscle-spasms-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"muscle spasms\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2572\">muscle spasms<\/a> can also present a problem that will cause pain and slow the healing process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anal Trauma: <\/strong>Fissures can happen due to an injury on the anus, for instance, in instances where one has a slip and fall, operations, or even the dangerous part of \u2018rough sex\u2019. Severe, painful tears can occur when the trauma affects the lining of the stomach.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs):<\/strong>\u00a0Some types of STIs that can affect the anal canal, for instance, syphilis or herpes, will always pose a threat to the development of fissures.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Rough Wiping or Excessive Cleaning:\u00a0<\/strong>Smearing after lavaging or using abrasive toilet paper can cause some irritation on the skin surrounding the anus, and with time, some minor ulcerations would develop.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other Medical Conditions:<\/strong> Other causes are far fewer; these include ailments such as rectal cancer or tuberculosis that may find their way to the anal region and cause a fissure. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Homeopathy for Rectal Fissure Work? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In treating Rectal Fissures, homeopathy has the advantage of being very safe for the patient while being effective.
