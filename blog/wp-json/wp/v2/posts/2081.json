It is from a subsection Ledum of the large genus Rhododendron in the family Ericaceae. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledum palustre is a low shrub growing to 50 cm (rarely up to 120 cm) tall with evergreen leaves 12\u201350 mm long and 2\u201312 mm broad. Ledum palustre is majorly found in northern latitudes in North America, Greenland, Canada, and Alaska, in Europe in the northern and central parts, and in Asia south to northern China, Korea and Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ledum Palustre Chemical Constituents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledum palustre has been used in homeopathy and traditional medicine to treat conditions like rheumatism, coughs, colds, and insect bites. However, internal use has become less common because of the toxicity of ledol. Some of the important natural chemicals found in Ledum palustre are flavonoids which include quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin derivatives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phenolic Acids contain gallic acid, ellagic acid, and caffeic acid derivatives. Terpenoids include monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Coumarins have fraxetin, fraxin, and esculin are some of the coumarins present.

This creates a concentrated liquid form of the plant\u2019s active compounds. The alcohol helps preserve the plant and draws out its beneficial chemicals like flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The final Ledum palustre preparation is available in either liquid tinctures or small pellets. It is commonly used for treating conditions like insect bites, joint pain, and inflammation, with the added benefit of being safe for pets in certain cases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ledum Palustre Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledum palustre mother tincture is a great natural medicine for wounds caused by bites, stings, or things like thorns and nails.
