It is a poisonous plant that belongs to the tribe Hyoscyameae of the nightshade family Solanaceae. Hyoscyamus niger is native to temperate Europe and Siberia and naturalized in Great Britain and Ireland. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyoscyamus niger is used in traditional herbal medicine to treat bone ailments, rheumatism, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-toothache-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"toothache\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"730\">toothache<\/a>, asthma, cough, nervous disorders, and stomach pain.

Scopolamine, better known as hyoscine, is known for its strong hallucinogenic effects and is used in some psychoactive drugs. Atropine is a racemic mixture of D-hyoscyamine and L-hyoscyamine, and its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyoscyamus niger also contains various other compounds, such as flavonoids, coumarins, sterols, tannins, and terpenes.
