It happens after the ovaries stop releasing eggs, and estrogen and progesterone \u2013 the two hormones that control the menstrual cycle \u2013 are no longer as prevalent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menopause occurs when a woman fails to have a menstrual period for twelve consecutive months. Women typically experience this change between the ages of 45 and 55. They commonly encounter symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Menopause<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The common symptoms of menopause can vary from person to person, and some people may have few or no symptoms.
