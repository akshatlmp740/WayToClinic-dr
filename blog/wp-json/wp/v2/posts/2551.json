Understanding what causes acid reflux can help manage and prevent it. Here are some common causes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hiatal Hernia: <\/strong>This is a condition in which one of the parts of the stomach rises through the diaphragm into the chest cavity, making the valve (LES) that is supposed to keep stomach acids away from the food tube.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Obesity:<\/strong> Other risk factors, such as obesity, cause pressure against the abdominal area, forcing stomach content back up the food pipe and thus causing acid reflux.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pregnancy:<\/strong> Acid reflux is very common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, because hormonal changes cause the stomach to rise. This is usually relieved after childbirth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Smoking:<\/strong> Smoking causes the LES to become weak, the stomach produces more acid, and throat muscles can be adversely affected, all of which lead to acid reflux.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diet:<\/strong> Some foods and beverages can cause or make acid reflux worse. These include fatty or fried foods, chocolate, foods with high amounts of citric acid like oranges and tomatoes, spicy foods, garlic, onions, alcohol, soft drinks, coffee, and tea.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Eating Habits: <\/strong>Reflux symptoms may worsen if one eats large meals, lies down soon after eating, snacks just before going to bed, or bends over after a meal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Medications<\/strong>: These drugs include aspirin, ibuprofen, muscle relaxants, and some medicines used for <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-blood-pressure-with-homeopathy\" title=\"blood pressure\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1312\">blood pressure<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slow Digestion:<\/strong> Some medicines and diseases that cause Delayed gastric emptying, such as <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-homeopathy\" title=\"diabetes\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1311\">diabetes<\/a>, put pressure on the stomach, hence increasing the chances of heartburn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stress:<\/strong> Stress does not cause acid reflux as a primary ailment but may cause situations such as overeating or eating foods that will worsen the condition.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Connective Tissue Disorders: Some diseases like scleroderma affect the muscles of the oesophagus<\/strong> through which endoscopy is accomplished and shall compromise its functionality, resulting in reflux symptoms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gerd Vs.
