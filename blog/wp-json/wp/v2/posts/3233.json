This process happens when the skin is overproducing melanin, the substance that gives skin color. This is more common in females, especially pregnant females (known as the mask of pregnancy) or females who use contraceptive pills. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melasma usually begins in adult women and can be aggravated by the sun, hormones, or some medications. Affected regions are normally the forehead, cheek area, nose as well as upper lip. Melasma is not damaging in any form but causes discomfort for most, especially since it is a skin condition that may affect one\u2019s appearance negatively. Treatments for the condition are topical steroids, laser therapy, and the use of lotions or creams, as well as protection from the sun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Melasma<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Brown or Grayish-Brown Patches:<\/strong> Melasma is generally characterized by dark brown or gray-brown localized skin discoloration involving the face. These regions of color alteration arise because of a bio-chemical called melanin, which is found primarily accountable for skin tone. The patches can be of any size but might be slightly darker than the skin color of the person affected.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Symmetry:<\/strong> The beauty of having melasma is that the melasma typically shows bilateral distribution, meaning it affects both sides of the face. For example, patches may be located on two cheeks or in the same area of the forehead, which visually will look identical on both sides.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Irregular Borders:<\/strong> If you enlarge the area of the skin involved in the presence of melasma, the border of the area is irregular. Depending on the individual\u2019s skin shade, the patch may fade and merge with the skin beyond or around the patch.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Pain or Itching:<\/strong> When it comes to discomfort and symptoms Melasma is not associated with this but painful or itchy skin. It is mainly a gingival condition with little functional significance. Nonetheless, in some instances, people could suffer minor inflection or sensitivity in that area, especially after the skin has peeled off or is concocted to harsh processes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Worsens with Sun Exposure:<\/strong> UV light exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for developing melasma. UV rays again cause melanocytes to produce melanin, often leading to the darkening of current skin moles or the development of new ones. Melasma sufferers tend to find that their skin changes color during summer or if they spend much time under the sun.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Melasma<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hormonal Changes:<\/strong> A lot of women are most commonly affected as hormonal changes play a significant role in causing melasma. Pregnancy, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or any form of hormonal treatment will predispose a woman to develop melasma. This is one reason it may be noticed in pregnant women, leading to a condition referred to as the \u201cmask of pregnancy.\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sun Exposure:<\/strong> UV actually activates melanocytes in the skin to produce melanin, which makes the skin become dark and produces dark spots. Melasma is also easily precipitated by environmental factors, and one of the most recognizable influences is ultraviolet radiation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Genetics:<\/strong> Melasma has a close relation with the family history of the patient. If a mother or sister has melasma, then one is more likely to have it as well. Various factors make some people more prone to the damaging effects of UV rays and hormonal fluctuations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Medications:<\/strong> Hormonal medications such as oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and drugs such as some anticonvulsants are known to cause melasma. These medications affect the hormones that are needed for its formation; therefore, when accompanied by sunlight, the likelihood of having the skin disease, melasma, is highly probable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Skin Irritation or Inflammation:<\/strong> Skin sensitivity due to skincare items, therapies, or allergies, and regular occurrences of skin inflammation can trigger melasma. In case the skin becomes inflamed, then it might produce more melanin, resulting in dark patches on the skin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Homeopathy for Melasma Work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeopathy is very effective in treating melasma compared to other treatments.
