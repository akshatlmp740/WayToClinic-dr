Step-by-Step Colocynthis Preparation includes;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Drying the Fruits:<\/strong> Begin by drying the colocynthis fruits in the shade at room temperature for ten days. This helps preserve the active compounds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Salvaging and Grinding: <\/strong>After drying, remove the seeds from the fruits and grind them into a fine powder to prepare for extraction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maceration with Ethanol: <\/strong>Take 100 milligrams of the powdered seeds and macerate them in ethanol for 72 hours. This process extracts the active compounds from the powder.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Filtering the Mixture:<\/strong> After maceration, filter the mixture under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. This step helps separate the crude extract from the ethanol solution.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Storing the Extract:<\/strong> The filtered crude extract weighs around 2.4 grams and should be kept at -20\u00b0C until it is ready for use.
