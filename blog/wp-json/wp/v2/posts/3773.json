The fever can be quite low, ranging between 99\u00b0F or 37.2\u00b0C and very high, including 103\u00b0F or 39.4\u00b0C depending on the virus causing the flu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viral fevers may occur due to flu, cold, or some serious diseases like <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-dengue-fever-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"dengue fever\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2681\">dengue fever<\/a>.
