Older adults may need assistance due to vision issues or difficulty reaching their feet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your ingrown nail isn\u2019t infected, manage symptoms at home by soaking your feet in warm water several times a day to reduce swelling and tenderness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your feet dry to prevent sweat and dampness, which can worsen the condition.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a wedge-like dental floss or cotton under the nail edge to lift it as it grows out; change it daily.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apply antibiotic cream and cover with a bandage to protect the toe<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opt for open-toed shoes or those with ample room in the toe area; avoid wearing heels<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate tenderness and swelling<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/lead.php?utm_source=weclinic&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=blog_side_banner\" aria-label=\"Weclinic desktop banner\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2.png\" alt=\"Weclinic desktop banner\"  srcset=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2.png 500w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2-50x50.png 50w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2-200x200.png 200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"   \/><\/a>\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeopathy offers a holistic approach to treating ingrown nails by addressing both the symptoms and underlying causes.
