It may involve regurgitation of food or sour fluid, nausea, bloating, gas, belching, and a sour or bitter taste in the mouth. Abdominal pain, bloating, and a feeling of having a lump in the throat are also common symptoms. Burping, belching, or a bloated stomach are other signs of <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-indigestion-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"indigestion\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1557\">indigestion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Acidity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many factors can contribute to acidity, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Overeating or consuming greasy foods:<\/strong> Eating large meals or foods that are high in fat can put pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This muscle acts as a valve between the stomach and esophagus. This can allow stomach acid to leak back into the esophagus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Eating too quickly: <\/strong>Eating too quickly can make it difficult for the stomach to digest food properly, leading to acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lying down after eating:<\/strong> Lying down after eating can also put pressure on the LES, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Eating before bed:<\/strong> Eating close to bedtime can increase the risk of acidity, as the stomach is less likely to have emptied by the time you lie down to sleep.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heavy food or spicy meals:<\/strong> Heavy or spicy meals can be more difficult for the stomach to digest, which can lead to acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fatty, processed, or high-fat foods, such as fried foods, cheese, and ice cream These types of foods can slow down digestion and put pressure on the LES, increasing the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fatty, fried, or processed meat, like bacon and sausages, is high in fat and can be difficult to digest, leading to acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Citrus fruits, tomatoes, and tomato-based foods:<\/strong> These foods are acidic and can irritate the esophagus, leading to acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Raw, spicy, or acidic foods like onions and garlic:<\/strong> These foods can irritate the esophagus and increase the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carbonated drinks like soda or beer: <\/strong>Carbonated drinks can put pressure on the LES and allow stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lack of sleep or stress:<\/strong> Lack of sleep and stress can both lead to increased production of stomach acid, which can increase the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Obesity:<\/strong> Obesity can put pressure on the stomach and LES, increasing the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hiatus hernia: <\/strong>A hiatus hernia occurs when the stomach pushes through an opening in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. This can weaken the LES and allow stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pregnancy:<\/strong> Pregnancy can cause hormonal changes that can weaken the LES and increase the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Certain medications like NSAIDs, antidepressants, and steroid hormones: <\/strong>Some medicines, such as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), antidepressants, and steroid hormones, can increase the risk of acidity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weakness in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES): <\/strong>A weak LES can allow stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, leading to acidity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Acidity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Common symptoms of acidity include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Heartburn:<\/strong> Heartburn is the most common symptom of acidity and is characterized by a burning pain or discomfort in the chest or throat.
