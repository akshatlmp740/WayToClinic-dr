An appropriate quantity of 100 grams of fennel seeds provides 1,440 kilojoules (345 kilocalories) of food energy. It is a rich source of protein, dietary fiber, B vitamins, and several dietary minerals, especially calcium, iron, magnesium, and manganese. Fennel seeds are 52% carbohydrates (including 40% dietary fiber), 15% fat, 16% protein, and 9% water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Foeniculum Vulgare Chemical Constituents.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The exquisite fragrance of fennel fruits comes from volatile oils that produces a variety of scents, including trans-anethole and estragole (which smell like liquorice), fenchone (with mint and camphor notes), limonene, and 1-octen-3-ol (which has a mushroom-like scent). Foeniculum vulgare or fennel fruits also contain other phytochemicals, such as polyphenols like rosmarinic acid and luteolin, though these are present in smaller amounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chemicals found in foeniculum vulgare plants, including phytochemicals and secondary compounds, could be used to create medicines like terpenoids, triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, polyacetylenes, and steroids. These substances have a wide variety of uses, including in food, medicine, drinks, spices, insect repellents, cosmetics, fragrances, and various industrial products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Foeniculum vulgare Preparation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Foeniculum vulgare is commonly known as fennel, and it has a long history of use in various traditional and herbal medicine systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some general methods of preparation of foeniculum vulgare:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Harvesting:<\/strong> Fennel is harvested throughout the growing season, but the leaves, seeds, and roots are commonly harvested at different times of season depending on the intended use of the plant.
