It is a type of flowering plant in the family of Hypericaceae. Hypericum perforatum is a perennial plant that grows up to one meter tall, with multiple yellow flowers that have clearly visible black glands around their edges, long stamens (male reproductive organs), and three pistils (female reproductive organs). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypericum perforatum plant is local to temperate regions across Eurasia and North Africa and has been introduced to East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of North and South America. The root of the hypericum perforatum plant is slender and woody, featuring numerous small, fibrous side roots as well as extensive, creeping rhizomes. The central root of the plant can extend to a depth of 0.6\u20131.5 meters into the soil, depending on the growing conditions and environment. Also, its root crown is woody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hypericum Perforatum Chemical Constituents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypericum perforatum contains multiple types of bioactive compounds, including naphthodianthrones like hypericin and pseudohypericin, flavonoids such as hyperoside, isoquercetin, and rutin, and phloroglucinols like adhyperforin and hyperforin. It is used in particularly treating effectively mild to moderate depression. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The therapeutic effects of hypericum perforatum are attributed to a diverse range of compounds, including naphthodianthrones (hypericin), phloroglucinol derivatives (hyperforin), and various phenolics (e.g., gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, rosmarinic acid), as well as flavonoids like hyperoside, isoquercetin, quercitrin, quercetin, and rutin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hypericum Perforatum Preparation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypericum perforatum is used for treating injuries and bruises of the nerves, like the tongue or fingers. It may also be helpful as a homeopathic treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a condition that causes severe facial pain. Hypericum perforatum is made into extracts and oils from its flowering parts. The way it is prepared and the solvent used will determine which plant chemicals are extracted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stirring:<\/strong> Mix 1 kg of raw hypericum perforatum with 7 kg of solvent in an inert gas environment at 55\u00b0C and stir it for one hour. Then, centrifuge to separate the extract. Repeat the process with another 7 kg of solvent to extract more from the remaining residue.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Boiling:<\/strong> Gently boil the resultant mixture for four hours until it reduces to about 250 mL. Allow it to cool to room temperature for some time, then filter through paper to clarify it. Next, centrifuge at high speed for 30 minutes and filter through a fine filter. The extract can be refrigerated at 4\u00b0C or freeze-dried for storage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evaporation:<\/strong> Combine the methanol extracts, then evaporate them under a vacuum at a temperature below 50\u00b0C until the volume reduces to 10 mL. Filter the desired sample through a fine PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene polymer) filter before using it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;text-align: center;\" id=\"wecli-2915534366\"><a href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/lead.php?utm_source=weclinic&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=blog_articles\" aria-label=\"WeClinic-Homeopathy\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy.png\" alt=\"\"  srcset=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy.png 943w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy-300x50.png 300w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy-768x128.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" width=\"943\" height=\"157\"  style=\"display: inline-block;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hypericum Perforatum Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypericum perforatum mother tincture is an effective homeopathic medicine that is derived from the plant family of Hypericaceae.
