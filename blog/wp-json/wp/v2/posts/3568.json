The incubation period for HMPV ranges from 3 to 6 days and the patient may be potentially infective in the absence of clinical manifestations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Common is HMPV Virus?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is believed that HMPV is responsible for 10%-12% of respiratory tract infections in children. Several complications are likely, and while the overwhelming majority of cases are mild, 5-16% of children are likely to suffer respiratory problems, and those may include lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Such severe forms are most commonly observed in children, older people, and patients with immunodeficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Homeopathy for HMPV Virus Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, homeopathy may act as an adjunct in the treatment of symptoms of the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) virus.
