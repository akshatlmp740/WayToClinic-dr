This can be further stored in capsules and used in various procedures.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extract:<\/strong> By using solvents like alcohol or glycerin, a concentrated extract of equisetum hyemale is made. It is used in creating supplements and topical preparations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Poultice: <\/strong>It is created by crushing or grinding fresh or dried horsetail and applying it directly to the skin. This method is used in topical benefits to reduce inflammation and promote healing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oil Infusion:<\/strong> It is infused in certain carrier oils such as olive or coconut oil and is left for over a few weeks which results in herbal oil.

Let us further learn in detail about the benefits of equisetum hyemale:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improves Bone Health:<\/strong> Due to osteoporosis, the bones become thin and weak, which increases the risk of fractures. This majorly occurs in postmenopausal women due to lower estrogen levels, with about 25% of them experiencing rapid bone loss.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduces Inflammation:<\/strong> Research has shown that the use of equisetum hyemale reduces inflammation markers and increases anti-inflammatory markers. Even a test-tube study also represented that horsetail can reduce inflammation in specific white blood cells too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lowers Blood Pressure: <\/strong>Recent studies have shown that equisetum hyemale significantly lowered both top and bottom blood pressure measures, similar to the effects of a common blood pressure medication taken by people.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lowers Blood Sugar: <\/strong>After consumption of equisetum, hyemale also helps lower blood sugar and improve insulin resistance in humans.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Promotes Hair Growth: <\/strong>Equisetum hyemale contains silicon, which reduces hair loss and improves shine.

Many scientific researches depict that the use of equisetum hyemale is limited and is used under strict supervision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Urinary tract infections (UTIs):<\/strong> Equisetum hyemale has diuretic properties, which means it can increase urine production and flow in the human body. It also has antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, which help in the possible treatment and prevention of bacterial UTIs. The diuretic effect of equisetum hyemale flushes out the toxins along with bacteria from the urinary tract. While the antimicrobial properties directly target the infectious agents present in the body.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kidney stones:<\/strong> The diuretic and mild astringent properties of equisetum hyemale are engaged in the prevention and treatment of kidney stones. Through increasing the flow of urine the small stones present can be easily flushed out of the body. Whereas, astringent compounds may help reduce the risk of stone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wound healing:<\/strong> Equisetum hyemale also has topical applications to heal cuts, burns, and other skin injuries. This wound-healing property present is due to the presence of silica, flavonoids, and other compounds that may support tissue repair and regeneration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Osteoarthritis and joint pain:<\/strong> It is considered a natural remedy to treat osteoarthritis and joint pain due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hair and nail health:<\/strong> It is also used as a natural treatment for strengthening hair and nails. This nature is due to the plant being a source of silica, a mineral that plays a crucial role in the structure and integrity of these tissues. Silica helps in improving the strength, growth, and overall health of hair and nails.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Equisetum Hyemale Homeopathic Uses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Equisetum hyemale is used to cure various medical conditions in homeopathic medicine.
