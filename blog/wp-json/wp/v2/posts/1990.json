It is a herbaceous, perennial plant found in the flowering plant family Apiaceae. It is found mainly in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, and islands in the western Pacific Ocean. It is widely used and consumed as a culinary vegetable and is used in traditional medicine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydrocotyle asiatica grows in temperate and tropical swampy areas in many regions across the world. The stems of Hydrocotyle asiatica are slender, creeping stolons, green to reddish-green, which connects the plants. It also has long-stalked, green, rounded apices which have smooth texture with palmately netted veins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hydrocotyle Asiatica Chemical Constituents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydrocotyle asiatica contains multiple chemical compounds like pentacyclic triterpenoids and trisaccharide derivatives, such as asiaticoside, brahmoside, asiatic acid, and brahmic acid (also known as madecassic acid). It also includes other chemical compounds like centellose, centelloside, and madecassoside. Around 124 different chemical compounds have been researched in hydrocotyle asiatica. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydrocotyle Asiatica contains multiple active chemical compounds, including triterpenoids and saponins like madecassoside, asiaticoside, centelloside, and Asiatic acid. These compounds help to promote cell growth, collagen production, and the formation of granulation tissue, as well as increase levels of DNA, protein, total collagen, and hexosamine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asiaticoside, a key saponin, specifically stimulates type-I collagen production in human skin cells when triterpenes such as Asiatic acid, madecassic acid, and asiaticoside from hydrocotyle asiatica were found to boost collagen production in a dose-dependent way. However, the specific activity of newly formed collagen decreased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hydrocotyle Asiatica Preparation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydrocotyle Asiatica, also known as Centella Asiatica or Gotu kola, is a type of perennial plant used in homeopathy to treat various medical conditions. The plant&#8217;s leaves are the most studied, researched, and commonly used to make extracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some methods for preparing these extracts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Alcoholic Solvent Extraction:<\/strong> Extract the aerial parts of the hydrocotyle asiatica plant while using an alcoholic solvent, then pass the resultant solution through an anionic resin. Then defat the eluate with the help of using a liquid\/liquid extraction method. The next includes concentrating the defatted aqueous-alcoholic phase into an aqueous phase. Then pass this aqueous phase through both cationic and anionic resins and lastly stabilize the aqueous phase with alcohol.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Water or Solvent Mixture Extraction:<\/strong> Take the aerial parts hydrocotyle asiatica and mix them with water or a solvent mixture containing at least 10% by weight, then pass the solution through an adsorbent resin. Elute the resin with a solution containing at least 30% by weight and pass it through a decolorizing resin. This whole process gives a discolored aqueous phase, which is concentrated to get extracted. The observed is dissolved in a solvent mixture of water and an alcoholic solvent at around 40\u00b0C.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Powder Extraction:<\/strong> The hydrocotyle asiatica herb is dried and pulverized into a fine powder. Next, add 20 grams of this powder to 100 milliliters of a 70% ethanol solution and stir the mixture vigorously for about five hours at 80\u00b0C. Filter the obtained mixture using filter paper and then freeze-dry it at -40\u00b0C for 48 hours. The resultant lyophilized powder is the crude extract of hydrocotyle asiatica.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;text-align: center;\" id=\"wecli-1193457827\"><a href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/lead.php?utm_source=weclinic&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_content=blog_articles\" aria-label=\"WeClinic-Homeopathy\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy.png\" alt=\"\"  srcset=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy.png 943w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy-300x50.png 300w, https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/WeClinic-Homeopathy-768x128.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" width=\"943\" height=\"157\"  style=\"display: inline-block;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hydrocotyle Asiatica Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydrocotyle asiatica mother tincture is a herbal remedy with anti-aging and anticonvulsant benefits.
