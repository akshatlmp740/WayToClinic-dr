It is a medium-sized hardwood deciduous tree. Robinia Pseudacacia belongs to the tribe Robinieae of the legume family Fabaceae. The roots of Robinia Pseudacacia contain nodules that allow the plant to fix nitrogen, as is common within the pea family. The trees of Robinia pseudoacacia reach a general height of 12\u201330 meters, which is 40\u2013100 feet, with a diameter of 0.61 &#8211; 1.22 m or 2\u2013 4 ft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robinia Pseudacacia Chemical Constituents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black locust or Robinia Pseudacacia leaves contain the chemical compounds like flavone glycosides which are characterized by spectroscopic and chemical methods as the 7-O-\u03b2-\u1d05-glucuronopyranosyl-(1\u21922)[\u03b1-\u029f-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-\u03b2-\u1d05-glucopyranosides of acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavone), apigenin (5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxyflavone), diosmetin (5,7,3\u2032-trihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavone) and luteolin (5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxyflavone). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flowers of Robinia Pseudacacia contain minerals like boron, arsenic, zinc, manganese, iron, magnesium, chromium, calcium, copper, and nickel.

The preparation starts with harvesting the fresh bark, leaves, or flowers of the Robinia Pseudacacia tree. Once collected, the plant material is cleaned and dried. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, a process called maceration is performed. This involves soaking the plant parts in alcohol and water. Over time, the active ingredients from the plant are extracted into the liquid mixture. After the extraction, the mixture is filtered to remove any solid plant particles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting liquid is called a mother tincture, which is a concentrated form of the medicine. After each dilution, the solution is shaken vigorously, a process known as succussion, which is believed to enhance the healing power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robinia Pseudacacia Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinia Pseudoacacia mother tincture is a useful medicine for treating too much stomach acid, which often leads to a <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-headache-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"headache\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2021\">headache<\/a> in the forehead.
