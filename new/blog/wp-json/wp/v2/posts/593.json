It has been used for centuries for its medicinal and recreational properties. Opium contains a variety of alkaloids, including morphine, codeine, and thebaine, which are responsible for its effects on the body. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeopathic Opium is a safe and effective treatment for a variety of conditions. However, it is essential to note that homeopathic Opium should not be used to treat acute pain or other severe medical conditions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opium has a long and complex history, dating back to ancient times. It was first used by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3400 BC. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans also used Opium for medicinal and recreational purposes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In homeopathy, Opium is used in highly diluted form to treat a variety of conditions, including pain, diarrhea, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-insomnia-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"insomnia\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"20\">insomnia<\/a>.

It is a potent alkaloid that is found in the opium poppy. Thebaine is used as an alternative to codeine in some cough suppressants.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Papaverine:<\/strong> This alkaloid has antispasmodic effects and is used to treat conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. It is found in the opium poppy and has been used for centuries to treat digestive issues. Papaverine is also used as an electrolyte replenisher in intravenous solutions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Narcotine:<\/strong> This alkaloid has stimulant and antispasmodic effects.
