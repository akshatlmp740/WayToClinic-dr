This allows the plant&#8217;s active ingredients to be extracted into the alcohol.<br><strong>Step 2: Filtration<\/strong><br>Once the plant material is macerated, the mixture is filtered to remove solids. The resulting liquid is the tincture.<br><strong>Step 3: Dilution<\/strong><br>The tincture is then diluted with water to create a homeopathic remedy. Homeopathic remedies are made by diluting a substance in a series of dilutions, each 10 times weaker than the previous one. This process is believed to increase the remedy&#8217;s potency.<br><strong>Step 4: Potencies<\/strong><br>The potency of a homeopathic remedy is determined by the number of dilutions it has undergone.
