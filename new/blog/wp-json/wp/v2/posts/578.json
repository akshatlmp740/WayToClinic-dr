Following extraction, centrifugation is performed to remove precipitates, and the alcohol acid solution is recovered under reduced pressure to yield a concentrate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>pH Adjustment and Solvent Extraction:<\/strong> The concentrate undergoes pH adjustment using a suitable agent to attain a pH value ranging from 9 to 14. Subsequently, the adjusted concentrate is subjected to extraction with an extraction solvent, typically ranging from 3000mL to 4000mL. The recovered solvent is then evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resultant product is dried to obtain nux vomica total alkaloids powder.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Supernatant Isolation:<\/strong> The nux vomica total alkaloids powder is dissolved in a mixed acid solution and then centrifuged to obtain the supernatant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Further pH Adjustment and Solvent Extraction:<\/strong> Using a pH adjusting agent, the supernatant&#8217;s pH value is adjusted to 10 to 13. This adjusted supernatant is then extracted with dichloromethane or ethyl acetate. After solvent recovery under reduced pressure and subsequent drying, nux vomica total alkaloids are obtained.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nux Vomica Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nux Vomica, also known as Strychnos Nux Vomica, is a plant belonging to the Loganiaceae family, commonly referred to as Poison Nut.
