This concentrated extract captures the therapeutic properties of the whole substance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mother Tincture<br><\/strong>The mother tincture is the original, undiluted form of Sepia. It is used to prepare the various potencies of the remedy. Due to its high concentration, the mother tincture is not typically taken directly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Potencies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeopathic remedies are typically diluted and potentized before being taken. This process involves diluting the mother tincture with a mixture of alcohol and water and then vigorously shaking the solution. This process is repeated multiple times, each time with a different dilution ratio. The most common potencies of Sepia are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>6X<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12X<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>30X<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>200C<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1M <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher the potency, the more diluted the remedy is. Higher potencies are generally used for more chronic conditions, while lower potencies are used for more acute conditions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dosage<\/strong><br>The dosage of Sepia will vary depending on the individual and the condition being treated. It is important to consult with a <a href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/\">qualified homeopath<\/a> to determine the correct dosage and potency. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Administration<\/strong><br>Sepia is typically taken orally by placing a few drops of the remedy under the tongue.
