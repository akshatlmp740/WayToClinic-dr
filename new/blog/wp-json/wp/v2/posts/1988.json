It is a type of perennial herb from the buttercup family known as Ranunculaceae, which is native to North America. The Hydrastis canadensis plant is distinguished by its thick, yellow-knotted rootstock. The stem of Hydrastis canadensis is purplish and hairy above ground and yellow below ground, where it connects to the yellow rhizome. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldenseal or Hydrastis canadensis reproduces both clonally through the rhizome and sexually, with clonal division more frequent than asexual reproduction. It has a fine hairy, upright, unbranched stem structure that grows to 15\u201350 centimeters (6\u201319+1\u20442 inches) in length.
