It is caused by a type of fungus called dermatophyte, which thrives in warm, moist environments. Ringworm can appear anywhere on the body, but it is most commonly found on the scalp, trunk, and limbs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its name, ringworm is not caused by a worm but rather by a group of fungi that feed on keratin, a protein found in skin, hair, and nails. The name ringworm comes from the characteristic ring-shaped rash that often develops on the skin, with a red, raised border and a clear center. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ringworm is highly contagious and can spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal or by sharing personal items like towels, clothing, or combs. The fungi can also survive on surfaces like floors, mats, or shared equipment, making it easy to contract ringworm in places like locker rooms, gyms, or swimming pools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of Ringworm<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ringworm of the Body (Tinea Corporis)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This is the most common form of ringworm, appearing as a red, circular rash with healthy skin in the middle.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It can spread outward while the interior area clears up, creating a ring-like pattern.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Itching is common, and the rash may be dry and scaly or wet and crusted<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It typically appears on the trunk, legs, or arms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ringworm of the Scalp (Tinea Capitis)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This form primarily affects children and causes scaly, red patches or bald spots on the scalp.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The scalp may become inflamed, and the hair may break off at the surface, leaving stubble.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It can cause itching, pain, swelling, and oozing or crusting of the scalp<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ringworm of the Groyne (Tinea Cruris or Jock Itch)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This type causes a red, itchy rash in the groin area, typically on the inner thighs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rash may be circular or ring-shaped, with raised edges and a precise center<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is more common in adults and is often caused by excessive sweating or friction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ringworm of the Feet (Tinea Pedis or Athlete&#8217;s Foot)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This fungal infection affects the soles of the feet and the spaces between the toes<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Symptoms may include itching, burning, scaling, and cracking of the skin<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The affected areas can become red, dry, and scaly or moist and raw<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ringworm of the Nails (Tinea Unguium or Onychomycosis)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This type causes thickening, yellowing, crumbly texture, and abnormal shape of the nails<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It can affect both fingernails and toenails, and the nails may become discolored or brittle<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In severe cases, the nail may separate from the nail bed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Ringworm Fungal Infection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms of ringworm can vary depending on the type of infection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Itchy, red, circular rash or ring-shaped lesions\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The rash may start as a small, raised area that slowly expands outward<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The center of the ring may appear clear or scaly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The edges of the ring are typically raised, red, and scaly or crusty<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bald patches or scaly areas on the scalp (in cases of ringworm of the scalp)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hair may break off at the surface, leaving stubble<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The scalp may become inflamed, swollen, oozing, or crusted<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cracked, blistered, or peeling skin between the toes (in cases of athlete&#8217;s foot)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The affected areas can become red, dry, and scaly or moist and raw<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There may be a burning or stinging sensation, especially after walking or sweating<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thickened, discolored, or crumbly nails (in cases of nail fungal infections)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The nails may turn yellow, brown, or white<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The nail may become thick, brittle, and separate from the nail bed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intense itching or burning sensation\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The itching can be severe, especially at night or when the affected area gets warm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scaling or flaking of the skin\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The rash may appear dry and scaly, with rough, flaky patches<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oozing or crusting of the affected area (in severe cases)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The rash may become weepy or ooze fluid, which can then crust over<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Ringworm<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ringworm is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes.
