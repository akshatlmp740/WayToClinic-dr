Infectious globally through food or water, people coming from regions with poor hygiene are more likely to be affected. The bacteria infects the intestinal tract and the circulatory system and may manifest as high fever, weakness, abdominal pain, headaches, loss of appetite, and possibly rash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not treated early enough, the condition can complicate things such as perforation of the intestines or organ inflammations. Any deviation of the heart working properly results in the accumulation of blood in the lungs leading to early detection and treatment with antibiotics or supportive care are sometimes necessary to avoid. The best ways of handling typhoid are through regular washing, taking our vaccines, and better-purified water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Typhoid Fever<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fever: <\/strong>The one sign that is most often reported is a slowly increasing fever that can rise to 103-104 F, 40-40 C.
