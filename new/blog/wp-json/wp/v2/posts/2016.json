It has a wide application in Ayurvedic medicine. The common names of gymnema sylvestre is gymnema, Australian cowplant, and Periploca of the woods. The leaves and extracts of Gymnema Sylvestre consist of gymnemic acids, which are the major bioactive constituents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These interact with taste receptors on the tongue to suppress the taste of sweetness in the body temporarily. The gymnema sylvestre plant is a climber with leaves having soft hairs on the upper surface. The leaves of gymnema sylvestre are elongated and oval. It has a small, yellow, umbelliferous inflorescence that is produced throughout the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gymnema Sylvestre Chemical Constituents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The leaves of gymnema sylvestre consists of chemical constituents such as triterpenoid saponins, flavonols, and gurmarin. The major biologically active plant molecules found are gymnemic acids, a class of triterpenoid saponins, which have the effect of suppressing the taste of sweetness on the tongue from sucrose (sugar), stevia, xylitol, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sweet-blocking effect of gymnema sylvestre lasts from 15 to 50 minutes and may even persist for a few hours. Gymnemic acids generally have no long-term effects on taste, and they do not influence bitter, salty, or sour taste sensations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gymnema sylvestre leaves consist of triterpene saponins, which belong to the oleanane and dammarene classes. Oleanane saponins are basically gymnemic acids and gymnemasaponins, while dammarene saponins are gymnemasides. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this, other plant constituents are flavones, anthraquinones, hentri-acontane, pentatriacontane, \u03b1 and \u03b2-chlorophylls, phytin, resins, d-quercitol, tartaric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, lupeol, \u03b2-amyrin related glycosides and stigmasterol. Leaves of this species yield acidic glycosides and anthraquinones and their derivatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gymnema Sylvestre Preparation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gymnema sylvestre, also known as gurmar in Hindi, can be prepared in several ways depending on the result desired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Leaves:<\/strong> To harvest the leaves and flowers, hands are used; a knife or a sickle can also be helpful. Spread the leaves out thinly in the shade for 7\u20138 days to dry, ensuring good airflow and avoiding direct sunlight. A plant that is 3\u20134 years old can produce 5\u20136 kg of dried leaves.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tea:<\/strong> Traditionally, people have made tea from the leaves or chewed them directly. Gymnema sylvestre tea is commonly used to control appetite and support <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-homeopathy-can-help-with-weight-loss\"   title=\"weight loss\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"781\">weight loss<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extract:<\/strong> To extract gymnemic acid from the plant, one method involves crushing the plant material and soaking it in 30\u201390% ethanol multiple times. The liquid is then filtered, and the ethanol is removed through ultrafiltration. Another method involves dissolving the extract in water, adjusting the pH with hydrochloric acid to precipitate gymnemic acid, and then stirring and drying it. The crude and raw gymnemic acid can be purified by recrystallizing it in a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other Forms:<\/strong> Gymnema sylvestre is also available in powder, tablet, or capsule form. Tablets and capsules are useful for ensuring accurate dosing and avoiding the risk of taking too much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gymnema Sylvestre Mother Tincture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gymnema Sylvestre mother tincture is a homeopathic medicine that helps regulate blood sugar levels and is useful in cases of poisonous snake bites. It also has immune-boosting properties. Made from the gurmar plant, also known as the sugar destroyer, this mother tincture of gymnema sylvestre can help in increasing insulin secretion and lowering blood sugar levels. The key ingredients of gymnema sylvestre mother tincture are the extract of perennial woody vine, ethanol, and water. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some benefits of gymnema sylvestre mother tincture:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gymnemic acids block sweetness receptors on taste buds, helping reduce sweet food intake.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It also boosts insulin release from the pancreas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supports the regeneration of pancreatic islet cells responsible for insulin production.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assists in managing and maintaining a healthy weight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits Of Gymnema Sylvestre<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gymnema sylvestre plant offers many health benefits, such as helping to reduce sugar cravings and lower high blood sugar levels. It is also helpful in fighting inflammation, supporting weight loss, and lowering bad or LDL <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-reduce-cholesterol-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"cholesterol\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"780\">cholesterol<\/a> and triglycerides.<br>Here are some key benefits of gymnema sylvestre:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduces Sugar Cravings: <\/strong>Gymnema sylvestre is found to decrease sugar cravings in the body and slow down the absorption of sugar and fat in the body. This is helpful in managing obesity, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-homeopathy\"   title=\"diabetes\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"779\">diabetes<\/a>, and high cholesterol. The active chemical compound in gymnema sylvestre is gymnemic acid, which particularly blocks sweet tastes without affecting other tastes. It can also reduce the desire for sugary foods, although the effect lasts for about an hour.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Boosts Insulin Production:<\/strong> Diabetes is a common condition observed in people where the body struggles to produce or use insulin in the right way. Gymnema sylvestre may help people to increase insulin production by promoting cell growth in the pancreas, where insulin is formed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lowers Sugar Absorption:<\/strong> Gymnema Sylvestre also reduces the amount of sugar absorbed in the intestines, which helps control blood sugar levels in people suffering from diabetes or prediabetes. Consuming 200 to 400 mg of gymnemic acid daily might lower glucose absorption in the intestines. Gymnema sylvestre supplements can also significantly reduce fasting blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Blocks Fat Absorption:<\/strong> Gymnema sylvestre also prevents the absorption of fats, helping to lower the bad LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.

Studies suggest that gymnema sylvestre can improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which contribute to lowering blood pressure. Additionally, compounds in gymnema sylvestre may increase the production of nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow, potentially reducing blood pressure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does Gymnema Sylvestre Treat?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gymnema sylvestre is a plant used for treating various health issues like diabetes, stomach problems, and malaria. It is also best known for lowering blood sugar and fat levels.<br>Here are some common medical conditions that are treated by gymnema sylvestre:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Diabetes:<\/strong> Gymnema sylvestre helps in managing diabetes by reducing blood sugar levels, curbing sugar cravings, and supporting the pancreas.
