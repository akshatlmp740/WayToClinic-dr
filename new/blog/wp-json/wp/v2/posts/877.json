Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is recommended most days.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:<\/strong> Being a higher weight can contribute to ED. Maintaining a healthy weight by consuming a balanced diet and exercising regularly is important.

These foods are high in antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients that can help maintain a healthy blood flow.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduce alcohol consumption:<\/strong> Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hormonal imbalances, nerve damage, and liver disease, all of which can contribute to ED. Men should consume no more than one drink per day and two drinks per day for women.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stop smoking:<\/strong> Smoking can lead to blood vessel damage, which can contribute to ED. It is important to quit smoking as soon as possible to improve overall health and reduce the risk of ED.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid certain foods:<\/strong> Some foods, such as spicy foods, alcohol, and chocolate, can contribute to ED. It is important to avoid these foods, especially before sexual activity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lifestyle Changes to Deal With Erectile Dysfunction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Manage stress and anxiety:<\/strong> Chronic stress and anxiety can contribute to ED. It is important to find healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, or therapy. Practising relaxation techniques before sexual activity can also help alleviate ED symptoms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Get enough sleep:<\/strong> Lack of sleep can disrupt hormonal balance and contribute to ED. Aiming for 7-9 hours of sleep per night is recommended.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid processed foods:<\/strong> Processed foods are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to weight gain, inflammation, and ED.

Consuming no more than 400mg of caffeine daily is recommended, equivalent to about four cups of coffee.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practice safe sex:<\/strong> Engaging in safe sex can reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, which can contribute to ED.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid certain medications:<\/strong> Some medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, and blood pressure medications, can contribute to ED. It is important to speak with a healthcare professional before taking any medication that may have potential side effects on sexual function.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider counseling: <\/strong>Counselling or therapy can help individuals address emotional and psychological factors that may contribute to ED, such as low self-esteem, relationship issues, or depression.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Get regular check-ups: <\/strong>Regular check-ups with a healthcare professional can help identify any underlying medical conditions that may contribute to ED.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practice stress-reducing techniques: <\/strong>Practising stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation can help reduce anxiety and stress, which can contribute to ED.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay active: <\/strong>Besides regular exercise, staying active throughout the day is important.
