This virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. DSS occurs when the virus provokes a severe immune response, resulting in a sudden drop in <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-blood-pressure-with-homeopathy\" title=\"blood pressure\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2563\">blood pressure<\/a>, organ dysfunction, and circulatory failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Dengue Shock Syndrome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms can vary depending on the underlying cause, but common signs include<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Acute Symptoms:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sudden onset of <strong>shock<\/strong>, characterized by <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-cold-with-homeopathy\" title=\"cold\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2565\">cold<\/a>, clammy skin, weak pulse, and low blood pressure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fever<\/strong> or history of fever.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abdominal pain<\/strong>, nausea, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/how-to-treat-vomiting-with-homeopathy\" title=\"vomiting\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2553\">vomiting<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bleeding symptoms<\/strong>, such as easy bruising or bleeding gums, may be present.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid breathing<\/strong> (tachypnea) and low urine output.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Late Signs (severe shock):<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Organ dysfunction<\/strong>, including liver failure, kidney failure, or cardiac dysfunction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mental confusion or lethargy due to hypoperfusion of the brain.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Petechiae<\/strong> (small, red spots) or <strong>ecchymosis<\/strong> (bruising) due to clotting issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Dengue Shock Syndrome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main causes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Viral Infection:<\/strong> Dengue is caused by one of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The infection can be asymptomatic or cause a range of symptoms from mild fever to severe illness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vascular Permeability:<\/strong> In DSS, the virus or the immune response can increase <strong>vascular permeability<\/strong>, leading to leakage of fluid from the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues. This causes a significant <strong>loss of plasma volume<\/strong>, which leads to <strong>hypovolemia<\/strong> (decreased blood volume).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shock:<\/strong> The drop in blood volume causes a <strong>decrease in blood pressure<\/strong>, resulting in <strong>shock<\/strong>. This reduces the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to vital organs, causing dysfunction or failure in organs like the heart, kidneys, and liver.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platelet Dysfunction:<\/strong> Dengue infections often cause <strong>thrombocytopenia<\/strong> (low platelet count), which can lead to <strong>bleeding tendencies<\/strong> and contribute to organ failure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cytokine Storm:<\/strong> In some cases, the body&#8217;s immune response to the virus (especially in secondary infections, i.e., when a person is infected with a different serotype of the virus) can cause an exaggerated inflammatory response or <strong>cytokine storm<\/strong>, further damaging blood vessels and increasing the risk of shock.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risk Factors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Secondary Dengue Infection:<\/strong> A second infection with a different dengue virus serotype increases the risk of DSS due to the <strong>antibody-dependent enhancement<\/strong> (ADE) mechanism, which facilitates viral entry into cells.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Age:<\/strong> Children and the olderly people may be at greater risk.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions:<\/strong> Conditions like malnutrition, chronic illness, or weakened immunity can also increase the risk of severe disease progression.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Delayed Medical Intervention:<\/strong> If the condition isn&#8217;t managed promptly, the shock can worsen, and the outcome may be fatal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Homeopathy for Dengue Shock Syndrome Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Homeopathy can be a complementary therapy for dengue Shock Syndrome, helping to alleviate symptoms and support healing. Common remedies include <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/weclinic.in\/blog\/eupatorium-perfoliatum-uses\" title=\"Eupatorium Perfoliatum\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2567\">Eupatorium Perfoliatum<\/a> for fever, Gelsemium as a sedative, and Bryonia as a muscle relaxant. While homeopathic treatment for dengue Shock Syndrome does not treat the virus itself, it may enhance immunity and recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research suggests that combining homeopathy with conventional medicine can improve symptoms and reduce recovery time.
