It affects the shoulder because the connective tissues around the area thicken and become sore, making it difficult for flexibility. The condition often comes slowly. Sufferers will primarily feel pain, which gets worse with time, before feeling stiff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen shoulder usually progresses through three stages: the freezing stage, during which pain rises and movement numbers drop; the frozen stage, where pain may decrease but stiffness remains; and the thawing stage, in which movement starts to get better. It is prevalent in humans between the ages of forty and sixty years. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it can be afflicting to anyone, especially those who have been idle for a long time due to injuries or operations. Such treatment involves physical therapy, pain relievers, and sometimes corticosteroid injections. Recovery may take between a few months to a few years, but many patients are likely to achieve substantial improvement concerning shoulder function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Symptoms of Frozen Shoulder<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, develops gradually and is marked by shoulder pain and stiffness, progressing through three phases:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Freezing Stage<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pain:<\/strong> Discharge, which may be described as thick, chunky, bony-hard or hard, white, curdy, and cheesy; Persistent dull or aching pain that increases with movement and is worse at night.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited Movement:<\/strong> Reduced mobility that affects ordinary functioning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frozen Stage<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduced Pain<\/strong>: Pain also decreases, but patients experience significant restrictedness of motion.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Restricted Motion<\/strong>: Severe restriction of active shoulder range, involving the inability to raise an arm overhead or backward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thawing Stage<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improved Mobility<\/strong>: Shoulder movement regains gradually despite a slight loss of movement range.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Residual Pain<\/strong>: In other words, movement is directly proportional to the reduction of pain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Frozen Shoulder<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, occurs when the connective tissue surrounding the shoulder joint thickens and tightens, causing pain and restricted movement.
